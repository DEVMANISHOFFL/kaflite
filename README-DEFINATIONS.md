What is a Broker?

Think of the Broker as the middleman between producers and consumers.
It’s responsible for:

Storing topics

Managing message queues

Handling publish and consume operations

In Kafka, brokers are distributed.
In KafLite, we’ll start with one in-memory broker — simple but functional.
